# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the complete functional and non-functional requirements for the OK Footwear ERP system. It is the primary technical reference for the implementation partner’s design, development, and testing activities. Every requirement is uniquely identified, prioritised, and assigned a verification method to enable traceability from requirement through to test and acceptance.

This document is intended to be a living specification: approved changes must be tracked through the version control table in the Document Control section.

## 1.2 Intended Audience

## 1.3 System Scope

The OK Footwear ERP system is a multi-module, web-based enterprise application covering the complete operational lifecycle of a shoe manufacturing company: from buyer order receipt through raw material procurement, factory production, outsourcing, inventory management, delivery, import/export, finance, HR & payroll, employee self-service, corporate reporting, system administration, and board governance.

The system will serve approximately 50 concurrent users across two locations (factory and corporate office) and must support bilingual operation in English and Bangla.

# 2. Overall Description

## 2.1 Product Perspective

The OK Footwear ERP system is a new, purpose-built application with no predecessor system. It replaces a collection of manual processes, paper registers, and standalone Excel workbooks that currently support day-to-day operations. The system will be the single system of record for all operational, financial, and HR data across both the factory and the corporate office.

The system will integrate with the following external components: biometric attendance devices (Phase 2), bank salary disbursement systems, email (SMTP) and SMS gateways, and optionally DocuSign/Adobe Sign for electronic signatures.

# 7. Use Cases

## UC-001: Register and Schedule a New Production Order

Main Flow:

- Order Manager navigates to Order Management → New Order.
- System displays the order registration form with buyer dropdown (pre-populated from buyer master).
- Order Manager selects the buyer, enters article/style, size run with quantities per size, unit price, currency, and target delivery date.
- Order Manager attaches the buyer’s tech pack and specification files.
- Order Manager selects Order Type = ‘Bulk Production’ and clicks ‘Save as Draft’.
- System validates all mandatory fields and checks that delivery date is at least 7 days from today.
- Order Manager clicks ‘Confirm Order’; system checks factory capacity against the delivery date.
- If capacity is available: system assigns a unique order number and auto-generates a backward milestone schedule.
- System sends a notification to the Factory Manager: ‘New order [ORDER-NO] confirmed. Review production plan.’
- Factory Manager reviews the order in the production planning board and allocates it to a production line.

Alternative Flows:

- AF-A: If the delivery date is less than 7 days from today, system displays a validation error and prevents confirmation.
- AF-B: If factory capacity is insufficient for the delivery date, system displays a warning (not a block) and prompts the Factory Manager to consider outsourcing.
- AF-C: If no Approved BOM exists for the article, system displays an alert; order can be saved as Draft but cannot be confirmed until BOM is approved.

Postconditions:

- A confirmed order with a unique order number exists in the system with status = Confirmed.
- A backward milestone schedule is visible in the production planning board.
- Factory Manager has been notified.

## UC-002: Process Purchase Requisition to Goods Receipt

Main Flow:

- System auto-generates purchase requisitions from the order BOM with item, required quantity, and required-by date.
- Procurement Manager reviews consolidated requisitions and groups items by vendor.
- Procurement Manager creates a PO for each vendor, enters unit rates, and saves.
- If PO value is above BDT 5,00,000: system routes for MD approval; MD receives notification.
- MD reviews and approves the PO; system generates a PDF PO document.
- Procurement Manager sends PO to vendor (email generated by system).
- On delivery: Store Officer creates a GRN against the PO, enters received quantity and lot/batch reference.
- QC Inspector records inspection outcome (Accept/Reject/Hold) per GRN line.
- Store Officer approves the GRN; system automatically updates inventory stock.
- Finance Officer receives notification of GRN for three-way match before vendor invoice payment.

Alternative Flows:

- AF-A: If received quantity is less than PO quantity, GRN is partially received; PO status = Partially Received; balance remains open.
- AF-B: If QC Inspector marks a GRN line as Rejected: system generates a Return-to-Vendor (RTV) document and debit note; rejected quantity is not added to inventory.
- AF-C: If vendor is not on the approved vendor list: system blocks PO creation and displays an error prompting the Procurement Manager to seek manager override.

Postconditions:

- GRN is approved and inventory stock is updated with the received quantity.
- Finance module has a pending vendor invoice to match.

## UC-003: Monthly Payroll Cycle

Main Flow:

- HR Manager navigates to Payroll → New Payroll Run, selects month and year.

Alternative Flows:

- AF-A: If an employee’s bank account is not configured: their salary is flagged as ‘Pending Bank Details’; the disbursement file excludes them until resolved.
- AF-B: Payroll reversal: if an error is discovered after disbursement, Finance Manager can initiate a reversal cycle which posts counter GL entries and allows a corrected re-run.

## UC-004: Conduct Board Meeting and Record Resolutions

Main Flow:

- Company Secretary navigates to Board → Board Meetings → Schedule Meeting.
- Enters date, time, venue/video link, and meeting type (Regular/Special).
- Builds the agenda: adds agenda items with supporting document attachments.
- System generates a meeting notice PDF (with agenda and supporting papers) and sends to all directors with read-receipt tracking.

- Line Manager reviews the request in MSS portal, views team leave calendar, and approves or rejects with comment.
- If approved by Manager and HR sign-off is required for the leave type: system routes to HR Officer.
- HR Officer approves; system updates employee leave balance and marks attendance records as On Leave.
- Employee receives a notification: ‘Your leave request for [dates] has been approved.’

Alternative Flows:

- AF-A: Insufficient balance: system displays warning; employee cannot submit without HR override.
- AF-B: Manager rejects with comment: employee receives rejection notification and can re-apply or appeal.
