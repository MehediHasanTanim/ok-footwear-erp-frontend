# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose of This Document

This Business Requirements Document (BRD) defines the complete set of business requirements for the design, development, and implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for OK Footwear Limited. It articulates what the business needs the system to do — not how the system will be built technically — and serves as the primary reference for all subsequent design, development, testing, and acceptance activities.

The BRD is based on extensive analysis of OK Footwear’s current operations, growth plans, regulatory obligations, and the detailed feature list compiled collaboratively by the management team.

## 1.2 Document Scope

This document covers requirements for all 15 modules of the OK Footwear ERP system:

- Order Management
- Procurement Management
- Bill of Materials & Costing
- Production Management
- Outsourcing Management
- Inventory Management
- Delivery & Dispatch
- Import / Export Management
- Finance & Accounts
- HR & Payroll
- Employee & Manager Self-Service Portal
- Reports & Analytics
- System Administration
- Board & Corporate Governance
- Implementation Phases

## 1.3 Intended Audience

## 1.4 Document Conventions

- SHALL — mandatory requirement that must be implemented
- SHOULD — strongly recommended requirement; deviation requires written justification
- MAY — optional requirement; included based on implementation phase and budget
- [OPTIONAL] — feature recommended but deferrable to a later implementation phase
- Requirement IDs follow the format: REQ-[MODULE]-[NNN] (e.g., REQ-ORD-001)

# 2. Business Background

## 2.1 Company Overview

## 2.2 Current Business Operations

OK Footwear operates as a vertically integrated shoe manufacturer with the following core workflows:

- Buyer orders are received from established clients such as Bay, Lotto, and Walker, specifying article, style, size run, quantity, unit price, and delivery deadline.
- On order confirmation, raw materials (uppers, soles, lining, adhesives, threads) and accessories (tags, labels, stickers, boxes, polybags) are procured from local vendors.
- Production is carried out in the company’s own factory. When capacity is exceeded, orders or sub-processes are outsourced to approved 3rd party factories.
- Finished goods are quality-inspected, packed, and delivered to buyers with supporting commercial documents.
- The company imports production machinery and spare parts from overseas. Export of finished shoes is in the growth plan.
- As a limited company, OK Footwear has a board of directors with defined shareholding, holds AGMs, and has statutory RJSC filing obligations.

## 2.3 Current State Challenges & Pain Points

## 2.4 Business Drivers for ERP Investment

- Revenue growth: increasing order volumes require structured planning and execution systems
- Export expansion: entering export markets requires compliance documentation, LC management, and real-time cost control
- Quality & compliance: buyer audits and regulatory requirements demand traceability and documented QC processes
- Corporate governance: as a limited company with multiple shareholders, structured board and AGM management is legally required
- Financial control: accurate, real-time cost tracking is essential for profitability management and investor reporting
- Labour law compliance: Bangladesh Labour Act obligations for payroll, provident fund, gratuity, and attendance records carry legal risk if managed manually

# 8. Assumptions

The following assumptions have been made in preparing this BRD. If any assumption proves incorrect, the scope, timeline, or budget may need to be revised.

- A reliable internet connection (minimum 10 Mbps broadband) will be available at both the factory and office locations for a cloud-hosted deployment.
- OK Footwear will designate a Project Manager and module-level business owners from within the organisation to participate actively in requirements validation, UAT, and go-live.
- Existing data (employee records, vendor masters, buyer masters, opening stock, and chart of accounts) will be provided in a structured format (Excel) for migration.
- The ERP will be a cloud-based or hosted solution; on-premise deployment is not preferred but may be evaluated.
- All users will have access to a PC, laptop, or tablet with a modern web browser.
- The organisation will invest in user training as part of the implementation and allocate sufficient time for staff participation.
- The board of OK Footwear will formally approve the BRD before development or procurement begins.
- Bangladesh Labour Act rules, NBR tax rates, and RJSC filing requirements in effect as of the date of this document will apply; the system vendor will be responsible for updates if regulations change.
- Biometric attendance devices will be procured separately and integrated in Phase 2; manual web-based clock-in will be used in Phase 1.
- The Company Secretary will own and manage the Board & Governance module with IT administrator support.

---

# 9. Constraints

- Budget: The total implementation budget is to be approved by the board; the phased delivery model is designed to manage cost exposure.
- Timeline: Phase 1 must be live within 4 months of project kick-off; production operations cannot be disrupted during the transition.
- Language: All documents generated by the system (payslips, challans, invoices) must support both Bangla and English output.
- Regulatory: The system must be configurable to reflect Bangladesh-specific tax rates, labour law rules, and RJSC form formats without custom code changes for each regulatory update.
- Connectivity: Factory floor terminals may have intermittent connectivity; the system must gracefully handle offline scenarios or provide a lightweight offline data entry mode.
- Data privacy: Employee NID, passport, and bank account data must never be exposed in plain text in any report, export, or log file.
- Integration: The salary disbursement file format must match the specific bank format used by OK Footwear’s primary payroll bank.
- Change management: The organisation has limited prior ERP experience; the system interface must be intuitive, and the implementation partner must provide comprehensive training.
