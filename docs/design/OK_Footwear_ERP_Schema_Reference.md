## Design Conventions

**UUID primary keys** — All PKs are `UUID` via `gen_random_uuid()` (pgcrypto). No auto-increment integers.

**Monetary values** — `NUMERIC(15,2)` for amounts; `NUMERIC(12,4)` for unit prices requiring four decimal places. Never `FLOAT`.

**Timestamps** — All timestamps are `TIMESTAMPTZ` (UTC). Display conversion happens in the application layer.

**Soft delete** — Master data uses `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ`; active records are filtered by partial unique indexes `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`.

**Status columns** — All `status` fields use `TEXT` with `CHECK` constraints (not PostgreSQL `ENUM`) for zero-downtime value additions.

**Sensitive fields** — NID, passport, and bank account numbers are stored as `BYTEA` (AES-256-GCM encrypted at app layer) in dedicated `*_secrets` tables.

**Generated columns** — Used for derived values that must stay in sync: `net_book_value`, `efficiency_pct`, `base_debit/base_credit`, `variance`, `downtime_hrs`.

## Schema: `sys` — System & Administration

Foundation tables shared by all modules: document numbering, authentication, RBAC, immutable audit logging, compliance tracking, and the notification system.

### `sys.document_sequences`

Stores auto-incrementing counters for generating human-readable business document numbers such as `ORD-000042`. The helper function `sys.next_doc_number(name)` atomically increments and formats the number.

⚪ **Lookup / configuration** — rarely changes once seeded

> **Note:** Seed one row per document type before go-live. Never truncate in production.

| Field           | Type       | Nullable | Key  | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sequence_name` | `TEXT`     | ✗        | `PK` | Unique name, e.g. `order`, `po`, `grn`, `gl_entry`     |
| `prefix`        | `TEXT`     | ✗        |      | String prepended to the number, e.g. `ORD-`, `PO-`     |
| `current_value` | `BIGINT`   | ✗        |      | Last issued value; next call returns current_value + 1 |
| `pad_length`    | `SMALLINT` | ✗        |      | Zero-pad width; 6 produces `000042`                    |

### `sys.roles`

Named roles assigned to users. System roles (`is_system = TRUE`) cannot be deleted.

⚪ **Lookup / configuration** — rarely changes once seeded

| Field         | Type          | Nullable | Key  | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | `UUID`        | ✗        | `PK` | Surrogate primary key                                          |
| `name`        | `TEXT`        | ✗        | `UK` | Unique role name, e.g. `finance_manager`, `factory_supervisor` |
| `description` | `TEXT`        | ✓        |      | Human-readable explanation of the role's purpose               |
| `is_system`   | `BOOLEAN`     | ✗        |      | TRUE means seeded at setup; must not be deleted                |
| `created_at`  | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | ✗        |      | UTC creation timestamp                                         |

### `sys.permissions`

Granular permission definitions: module + action. Seeded once; referenced by role-permission assignments.

⚪ **Lookup / configuration** — rarely changes once seeded

| Field         | Type   | Nullable | Key  | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `module`      | `TEXT` | ✗        |      | Module the permission covers, e.g. `orders`, `payroll`, `board`                              |
| `action`      | `TEXT` | ✗        |      | Allowed action: `read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, or `approve`; UNIQUE per module-action |
| `description` | `TEXT` | ✓        |      | Plain-language description of what this permission grants                                    |

### `sys.role_permissions`

Junction between roles and permissions. A user's effective permissions are the union of all permissions across all their roles.

### `fin.gl_entry_lines`

Double-entry journal lines. Partitioned by `entry_date` (yearly). Every journal must balance: SUM(debit) = SUM(credit) — enforced by trigger on posting.

🔴 **Append-only ledger** — never UPDATE or DELETE; insert only

> **Note:** `base_debit` and `base_credit` are generated columns storing BDT equivalent after FX rate. CHECK ensures exactly one of debit/credit is non-zero per line.

## Materialized Views

Two materialized views aggregate expensive queries. Both must be refreshed by a scheduled job after batch operations.

### `brd.current_shareholding`

Aggregates all share transactions to compute current shares held and percentage ownership per shareholder. Refresh after every share transaction batch.

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY brd.current_shareholding;
```

## Functions & Triggers

### `sys.next_doc_number(p_seq TEXT) → TEXT`

Atomically increments the named sequence counter and returns the formatted document number. Uses row-level locking to prevent duplicates under concurrent requests.

**Parameters**

- `p_seq TEXT` — sequence name from `sys.document_sequences`, e.g. `'order'`, `'po'`

**Returns** — formatted string, e.g. `ORD-000042`

**Example**

```sql
SELECT sys.next_doc_number('order');   -- 'ORD-000001'
SELECT sys.next_doc_number('po');      -- 'PO-000001'
```

### `hr.compute_gratuity(p_employee_id UUID, p_exit_date DATE) → NUMERIC(14,2)`

Computes gratuity entitlement under Bangladesh Labour Act 2006. Formula: `Basic × (30/26) × Completed Years`. Fractional years: < 6 months ignored; ≥ 6 months rounds up to one full year. Returns 0 if service < 1 year.

**Parameters**

- `p_employee_id UUID` — employee to compute for
- `p_exit_date DATE` — exit or calculation date (defaults to `CURRENT_DATE`)

**Example**

```sql
SELECT hr.compute_gratuity('a1b2c3d4-...', '2026-03-31');  -- returns 45000.00
```

### `inv.update_stock_balance()` — Trigger function

Fired `AFTER INSERT` on `inv.stock_transactions`. Uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` (upsert) to maintain the running balance and weighted average cost in `inv.stock_balances`. Applied to all partition children automatically.

### `fin.check_period_open()` — Trigger function

Fired `BEFORE INSERT` on `fin.gl_entry_lines`. Raises `EXCEPTION` if the corresponding `fin.gl_periods.status = 'locked'`, preventing any posting to a locked period at the database level.

### `sys.set_updated_at()` — Trigger function

Fired `BEFORE UPDATE` on every table that has an `updated_at` column. Sets `NEW.updated_at = NOW()`. Applied to 34 tables across all schemas via individual `CREATE TRIGGER` statements.

## Partitioned Tables

Six high-volume tables are partitioned by date `RANGE` to keep index sizes manageable and enable old-year archiving by partition detachment.

| Table                    | Partition key | Strategy     | Pre-created      | Recommended schedule                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sys.audit_logs`         | `created_at`  | RANGE yearly | 2025, 2026, 2027 | Create next year partition in November each year        |
| `sys.notifications`      | `created_at`  | RANGE yearly | 2025, 2026       | Create next year partition in November each year        |
| `inv.stock_transactions` | `txn_date`    | RANGE yearly | 2025, 2026       | Create next year partition in November each year        |
| `mfg.daily_productions`  | `prod_date`   | RANGE yearly | 2025, 2026       | Create next year partition in November each year        |
| `hr.attendance_records`  | `check_date`  | RANGE yearly | 2025, 2026       | Create next year partition in November each year        |
| `fin.gl_entry_lines`     | `entry_date`  | RANGE yearly | 2025, 2026, 2027 | Create next two years' partitions in November each year |

> **Warning:** If a partition does not exist when a row is inserted, PostgreSQL will raise an error. Automate partition creation with a scheduled job or use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ... PARTITION OF ...` in a monthly maintenance script.
